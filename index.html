      <h3>Why I became a Software developer</h3>
      <p>
        This questions is very hard to explain.
        To be honest at first I found it extremely difficult to code in general.
        Reading and understanding code and its structures was really hard for me to understand
        and took some time to get the basics right.
        I am lucky to have a don't quit personality as it helps me to push through
        those hard times and after a while it just started to click.
        I understood more of why and how the flow and commands worked.
        This is where I started to fall in love with coding.
        It was the challenge of creating something someone needs in a languages that very
        few people understand.
        So I became a software developer for the challenge
        and stayed for the challenges that came with every new project.

    <h3>Why I Like Web Development</h3>
    <p>
      Of all the coding languages I have worked on, web deelopment is the one I always come back to.
      For me there is more of an accomplishment of completing a website for a user.
      This is one of the few languages that people interact with your code, for example
      a plain command like hover that increases an image size as you mouse over seeing how people
      interact and play with these different functions on a website.
      Seeing them smile and just play around to see what else they can do
      brings a form of satisfaction of a job well done to me.
      While other languages like C# are mostly hidden from the users.
